\begin{ddef}[Well-posed Problem]
Is a problem 
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item with solution, 
    \item unique solution and 
    \item the solution depends continuously on the data. 
\end{enumerate}
        Ill-posed are problems that are not well-posed.
\end{ddef}

\begin{remarks}
The prototypical problem in inverse problems:
    $$\int_\Omega syst \times input = output$$
\end{remarks}

\begin{ddef}[Fredholm Integral Equation]
$$\int_0^1 K(s,t) f(t) dt = g(s) $$  
where $0<s<1$, $K$ the smoothing kernel is known. $f$ is wanted. And $g$ is continuous.\\
The discretization $\int_0^1 K_i f(t) dt =b_i$ where $K_i(t) \equiv K(s_i,t)$ is a continuous function of $t$ and $b_i=g(s_i)$. 
\end{ddef}  

\begin{teorema}[The Riemann Lebesgue Lemma]
The quid to this theorem is that when the frequency goes to infinity we can expect the integral to tend to zero. $p\to \infty \implies g\to 0$.
\end{teorema}

\begin{ddef}
\textbf{Singular Value Decomposition}
Suppose $K(s,t)$ is square integrable: $$ |K|^2 = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 K(s,t)^2 ds\, dt<\infty$$ 
Then $K$ can be written as: $K(s,t)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu_i u_i(s)v_i(t)$ almost everywhere. $u_i$ and $v_i$ are ortonormal sequences.
\end{ddef}

\begin{ddef}[Fundamental Relation]
Since the sequences are ortonormal: $\int_0^1 K(s,t)v_i(t) dt = \mu_i u_i(s)$
\end{ddef}
