We continue using using quadrature rules. $f$ is now a discretized vector. The action $K(s,t)$ is a matrix $(A)$. We are trying to recover the vector $x$ by solving the system $Ax=b$. The singular value descomposition $A=U\Sigma V^*$.

The singular values decrease. We replace $A$ by:
$$A_{(k)} = \sum_{i=1}^k \sigma_i u_i v_i^T$$
Assuming that $A$ is invertible $x=A^{-1} b$ then:
$$A ^{-1} b = \sum \frac{1}{\sigma_i} v_i u_i^T b$$
note that $1/\sigma_i$ and $u_i^Tb$ are scalars; then;
$$=\sum \frac{u_i^Tb}{\sigma_i}v_i$$
\begin{ddef}[Truncated Singular Value Decomposition]
Is solving the linear system by the approximation:
$$x_{(k)}=\sum \frac{u_i^Tb}{\sigma_i}v_i$$
\end{ddef}
